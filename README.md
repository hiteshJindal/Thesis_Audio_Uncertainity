# Thesis_Audio_Uncertainity
Feature Uncertainty from Audio Noise

Here now I upload the files Mail_thesis_file_with_spectrograms and Mail_thesis_file_without_spectrograms where you can find both code before and after including mel spectrograms also there is an additional Mail_thesis_file_noise_with_spectrograms where I add noise in input data and perform the same steps.

## 17th August

I uploaded the file Mail_thesis_file_Noise_withoutspectrograms_16thAug_v3.ipynb today, here I added the code where I use the oversampling technique to balance the imbalance dataset and also I added the code for keras tuner and k fold cross validation to improve the Validation and test accuracy. After all the steps, validation accuracy reached 87%, whereas the test accuracy is around 50%.
