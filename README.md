# Thesis_Audio_Uncertainity
Feature Uncertainty from Audio Noise

Here now I upload the files Mail_thesis_file_with_spectrograms and Mail_thesis_file_without_spectrograms where you can find both code before and after including mel spectrograms also there is an additional Mail_thesis_file_noise_with_spectrograms where I add noise in input data and perform the same steps.
